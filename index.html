             Chernihiv is not only an historical town for me, but it's also a town where I grew up, graduated from
             University, and worked as a lawyer.

          <p>
              Until the war it was the town where my friends and I lived.

            <p>
                Chernihiv's architectural monuments chronicle the two most flourishing periods in the city's history –
                those of Kievan Rus' (11th and 12th centuries) and of the Cossack Hetmanate (late 17th and early 18th
                centuries).

          <h2>History</h2>
          <h3>Early history</h3>
          <p>
              Chernihiv was first mentioned  in the Rus'–Byzantine Treaty (907), but the time of its establishment is
              unknown. Artifacts from the Khazar Khaganate uncovered by archaeological excavations at a settlement there
              indicate that it seems to have existed at least as early as the 9th century. Towards the end of the 10th
              century, the city probably had its own rulers. It was there that the Black Grave, one of the largest and
              earliest royal mounds in Eastern Europe, was excavated in the 19th century.
          </p>
          <p>
              The city was the second wealthiest and most important in the southern portion of the Kievan Rus'. From the
              early 11th century on, it was the seat of the powerful Principality of Chernigov, whose rulers at times
              vied for power with Kievan Grand Princes, and often overthrew them and took the primary seat in Kiev for
              themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
              The grand principality was the largest in Kievan Rus and included not only the Severian towns but even
              such remote regions as Murom, Ryazan and Tmutarakan. The golden age of Chernigov, when the city population
              peaked at 25,000, lasted until 1239 when the city was sacked by the hordes of Batu Khan, and entered a
              long period of relative obscurity.
          </p>
          <p>
              The area fell under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1353. The city was burned again by Crimean khan Meñli
              I Giray in 1482 and 1497 and in the 15th to 17th centuries changed hands several times between Lithuania,
              Muscovy (1408–1420 and from 1503), and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1618–1648), where it was granted
              Magdeburg rights in 1623 and in 1635 became a seat of Chernihiv Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province.
          </p>
          <p>
              The area's importance increased again in the middle of the 17th century during and after the Khmelnytsky
              Uprising. In the Hetman State, Chernihiv was the city of deployment for the Chernihiv Cossack regiment
              (both a military and territorial unit of the state at the time).
          </p>
          <h3>Imperial Russia</h3>
          <p>
              Under the 1667 Treaty of Andrusovo the legal suzerainty of the area was ceded to the Tsardom of Russia,
              with Chernihiv remaining an important center of the autonomous Cossack Hetmanate. With the abolishment of
              the Hetmanate, the city became an ordinary administrative center of the Russian Empire and a capital of
              local administrative units. The area in general was ruled by the Governor-General appointed from Saint
              Petersburg, the imperial capital, and Chernihiv was the capital of local namestnichestvo (province) (from
              1782), Malorosiyskaya or Little Russian (from 1797) and Chernigov Governorate (from 1808).
          </p>
          <p>
              According to the census of 1897, the city of Chernihiv had 11,000 Jews out of a total population of 27,006.
              Their primary occupations were industrial and commercial. Many tobacco plantations and fruit gardens in
              the neighborhood were owned by Jews. There were 1,321 Jewish artisans in Chernihiv, including 404 tailors
              and seamstresses, but the demand for artisan labor was limited to the town. There were 69 Jewish
              day-laborers, almost exclusively teamsters. Few, however, were employed in factories.
          </p>
          <h3>World War II</h3>
          <p>
              During World War II, Chernihiv was occupied by the German Army from 9 September 1941 to 21 September 1943.
              The Germans operated a Nazi prison and a forced labour battalion for Jews in the city.
